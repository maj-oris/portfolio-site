This is a very simple application I wrote a while ago when starting out with PHP. It's a barebones (I didn't want to bother with CSS too much, I was focusing on PHP functionality) application which allows you to create notes, delete them, and while I wanted to get an edit function working, I ended up moving onto other projects instead.

If I was to do this again, I'd definitely plan it a lot better rather than simply diving in and ending up with spaghetti code. For instance, I wouldn't want to use both $_SESSION and forms to transmit data; I'd choose one or the other. I'd also want to extend the functionality to do things such as rearrange the order in which the cards are displayed. Further, I might want to implement a reminder functionality where cards can be set to alert you when you open the application on a particular day.
