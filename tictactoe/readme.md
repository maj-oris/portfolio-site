This is a game of tic-tac-toe with an AI opponent written in JavaScript. It doesn't work yet, but will soon. You can click around if you want, though. The AI will make random moves. I do plan to implement an AI using a minmax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning soon.

To run this, download index.html, style.css, and script.js. Put them in the same folder and open index.html with your web browser.
