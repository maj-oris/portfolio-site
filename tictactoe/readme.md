This is a game of tic-tac-toe with an AI opponent written in JavaScript. It doesn't work yet, but will soon. You can click around if you want, though. The AI will make random moves.

To run this, download index.html, style.css, and script.js. Put them in the same folder and open index.html with your web browser.
