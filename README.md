I'm an extremely creative person and always have been; I love to do things for myself and I love programming. Whenever I've encountered anything I find remotely interesting, from creative writing to programming to art, I've felt an irresistable pull to create such a thing myself. The process of creation, and the process of learning to create, has been my driving-force for as long as I can remember - and, fortunately, I find there's no better way for me to learn than to do, so these two things are inherently tied together. This repository is a place where I will store many hobby projects that I've coded, even if they're old or not very good.
