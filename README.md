# portfolio-site

For now, this portfolio contains only one small website project. I'm an extremely creative person and always have been; I love to do things for myself and I love programming. Whenever I've encountered anything I find remotely interesting, from creative writing to programming to art, I've felt an irresistable pull to create such a thing myself. The process of creation, and the process of learning to create, has been my driving-force for as long as I can remember - and, fortunately, I find there's no better way for me to learn than to do, so these two things are inherently tied together. This repository is a place where I will store many hobby projects that I've coded.

Coming next (in the next few days!) will be an implementation of snake in written JavaScript, and an implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with an AI opponent written in Python. There'll be even more, but my other saved projects require a little more polish before I'll be entirely comfortable with letting the world see them.

After those two, I've always liked the idea of writing a game of chess with an AI opponent. Maybe I'll turn my attention to that. I'd like to create an (optionally SPA) website for it to run on, too, so anyone with a web-browser can run and enjoy it.
