# portfolio-site

For now, this portfolio contains only one small website project. I'm an extremely creative person and always have been; I love to do things for myself and I love programming. I find there's no better way for me to learn than to do. This repository is a place where I will store many such hobby projects.

--------------------------------

The contents of site are the website itself, and this folder should be run on a PHP server.

The contents of site-data are the database, and this folder should be placed within mysql/data.

This site is designed to be accessed locally via localhost.
